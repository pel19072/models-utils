# Utilities

## Description

Shared utility modules in `database_utils/utils/` (24 modules) plus the
supporting `dependencies/` and `middleware/` packages. The two largest —
the workflow engine and provisioning resolution — have their own page:
[workflow-engine.md](workflow-engine.md).

## Goal

Eliminate duplication across auth-erp and backend-erp by centralizing common
patterns, and host all logic the workflow engine needs (backends import this
library, never the reverse).

## Utility Modules (in `database_utils/utils/`)

| Module | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `workflow_engine.py` (58 KB) | Trigger matching + async DAG execution (`check_workflow_triggers`, `execute_workflow`, `execute_step`) — see [workflow-engine.md](workflow-engine.md) |
| `network_graph.py` | The **only** place the company plant tree is walked (Cycle 10, doc 35 §3) — see below |
| `provisioning_resolution.py` | Resolves a service's configuration path, its per-node playbooks and its variable frames (moved down from backend-erp in Cycle 3; **rewritten in Cycle 10** to traverse the graph instead of matching a topology chain) — see below |
| `provisioning_runs.py` | Opens and advances a multi-device `ProvisioningRun` (Cycle 10, doc 35 §5) — see below |
| `jwt_utils.py` | HS256 JWT create/decode. Env: `SECRET_KEY`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE` (minutes, default 1440), `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE`. **Fails fast if `SECRET_KEY` is unset when `ENVIRONMENT=production`**; dev fallback otherwise |
| `permission_utils.py` | `PermissionChecker` and require-permission FastAPI dependencies |
| `audit_utils.py` | `log_create_operation` / `log_update_operation` / `log_delete_operation` / `log_custom_operation` helpers writing `AuditLog` rows |

| `workflow_fields.py` | Trigger-context variable/field handling for workflow steps |
| `tier_limits.py` | Tier resource-cap enforcement |
| `pagination_utils.py` | Pagination helpers returning `PaginatedResponse[T]` |

| `router_factory.py` | FastAPI router factory helpers |

## The provisioning trio (Cycle 10, doc 35)

These three modules are read together: `network_graph` produces the path,
`provisioning_resolution` turns it into playbooks and variables, and
`provisioning_runs` executes it as one child job per device. All three live here
rather than in backend-erp because the workflow engine's `ENQUEUE_PROVISIONING`
step calls them and the import direction is strictly downward.

### `network_graph.py`

The plant is a strict tree of `inventory_item` rows joined by `parent_id`, and
this module is the only place that walks it. Written against SQLAlchemy Core's
recursive-CTE API rather than raw `text()`, so the same code runs on Postgres and
on the in-memory SQLite the unit tests build with `create_all`.

| Name | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `MAX_PATH_DEPTH = 32` | Hand-kept in sync with the same constant inside `trg_inventory_item_graph_guard` (revision `ng1_network_graph`). If they disagree the trigger wins, and traversal starts raising `PATH_TOO_DEEP` on paths the DB happily accepted |
| `GraphError(code, detail)` | `code` is stable and API-facing (`PATH_TOO_DEEP`) |
| `resolve_path(db, item_id, company_id) -> list[InventoryItem]` | The node itself, then every ancestor, ordered **leaf → root**. Returns `[]` for an unknown item or one belonging to another company; raises `GraphError("PATH_TOO_DEEP")` past the bound |
| `descendants(db, item_id, company_id)` | Everything behind a node, excluding the node itself, ordered by depth (nearest first). Impact analysis: "who is affected if I re-parent or take down this OLT?" |
| `would_create_cycle(db, item_id, new_parent_id, company_id) -> bool` | Service-layer pre-check mirroring the DB trigger, so the API can answer 422 with a readable message instead of surfacing a raised Postgres exception. The trigger remains the guarantee; this is the courtesy, and the two must stay in agreement |
| `child_count(db, item_id, company_id) -> int` | Immediate children only — the detach guard and the tree UI |

Two invariants are load-bearing and appear in every query here:

1. **`company_id` is filtered in BOTH the anchor and the recursive term.** A
   cross-tenant tree cannot be produced through the API (the trigger rejects a
   cross-company parent), but a traversal that only filtered its anchor would
   still happily follow such an edge if one ever appeared through a direct DB
   write. Filtering both terms makes cross-tenant traversal impossible rather
   than merely unlikely — and `test_network_graph_traversal.py` proves it by
   writing an illegal edge with raw SQL, past both the service layer and the
   trigger.
2. **Every recursion is bounded by `MAX_PATH_DEPTH`.** An unbounded recursive CTE
   over a cycle does not error, it hangs — the worst possible failure mode for a
   query on the provisioning hot path.

`_ordered_items` re-hydrates the ORM objects in the order the CTE produced: the
CTE returns ids, and a plain `IN (...)` re-query returns them in whatever order
the planner likes. Path order is load-bearing, so it is re-imposed, not trusted.

### `provisioning_resolution.py`

`resolve_provisioning(db, client_service, purpose=PURPOSE_ACTIVATION)` starts at
the service's CPE and walks to the root:

1. `client_service.cpe_item_id` unset → **`CPE_NOT_SET`**
2. that CPE not attached to the graph → **`CPE_NOT_ATTACHED`**
3. `path = resolve_path(cpe)`, leaf → root (a `GraphError` is re-raised as a
   `ResolutionError` carrying the same code)
4. a node whose category `is_passive` contributes nothing but stays on `path`
5. every other node resolves **node override → device-type default → none**
   (`resolve_playbook_for`, one helper so the resolver, the API path preview and
   the node detail endpoint share one lookup semantics)
6. an active node with no playbook for the purpose is reported
   **`PLAYBOOK_NOT_BOUND`** — fatal for `ACTIVATION` unconditionally, and for
   other purposes only when some playbook on the path actually reads a
   device-derived variable (the pre-existing amendment-4 rule). A bound playbook
   that is inactive or belongs to another company raises **`PLAYBOOK_INACTIVE`**;
   a per-service parameter that is blank *and* referenced by a playbook on the
   path raises `RESOLUTION_FAILED` with `MISSING_SERVICE_PARAM` errors.

Step 6 preserves the fatality posture exactly: ACTIVATION fails visibly (a
half-provisioned install is worse than a refused one), while a SUSPENSION whose
OLT happens to have no suspend playbook still suspends whatever it can.

**Retired with the chain, and they cannot occur any more:** `MISSING_DEVICE`,
`AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, `PINNED_DEVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, `TOPOLOGY_NOT_SET`,
`TOPOLOGY_INACTIVE`, `PURPOSE_NOT_CONFIGURED`. Every node on the path *is* a
concrete device, so there is nothing left to match or disambiguate — which
deletes the single most common class of provisioning failure in the old system.

Returns two dataclasses:

- `ResolvedNode` — `position` (hop count from the CPE, 0-based leaf → root),
  `item_id`, `serial_number`, `mac_address`, `device_type_id`,
  `device_type_name`, `category_key`, `category_tier`, `mgmt_host`, `mgmt_port`,
  `is_passive`, `playbook_id`, `playbook_source` (`"node"` | `"device_type"` |
  `None`). `position` is a **fact about the resolved path, never an addressing
  mechanism** — nothing templates it.
- `ResolvedProvisioning` — `path` (every node, passives included, so an operator
  can see that a splitter was considered and deliberately skipped rather than
  wondering where it went), `steps` (the subset that will be configured),
  `shared_variables`, `device_variables` (`item_id → that node's device.* frame`).

**Two dicts, deliberately.** `device.*` means "the box this playbook is running
on", so it differs per child job; a single flat dict cannot express that. The
path-scoped half is identical for every node and is resolved once. Each child
job's `variables` column is written as
`shared_variables | device_variables[item_id]`, so the executor and the renderer
still receive exactly one flat dict and their contract is untouched.

#### The variable namespace

| Namespace | Contents |
|---|---|
| `device.<attr>` | the device **this playbook is running on** |
| `cpe.<attr>` | the subscriber edge device that triggered the run (the leaf, always `path[0]`) |
| `path.<category_key>.<attr>` | any node on **this run's** path, named by its device-category key; **nearest-to-the-CPE wins** if a role repeats. Passives are addressable too (a playbook may legitimately want the splitter's serial for a description field) |
| `service_plan.<field\|param>` | plan fields plus the plan's tenant-authored rows (`plan`- and `service`-scoped alike — the author writes `{{service_plan.<key>}}` either way) |
| `client.<attr>` | built-in subscriber fields plus the tenant's own client custom fields (built-ins win a clash) |
| `service.<attr>` | the `client_service` itself |
| `input.<key>` | author-declared playbook variables; the namespace is applied at REFERENCE time by `input_key()`, the declared key stays bare |

`DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES = ("item_id", "serial", "mac", "type", "category",
"category_tier", "mgmt_host", "mgmt_port", "depth")` — one tuple shared by all
three device namespaces, built by `build_device_frame(node, prefix)`. `depth` is
hops from the CPE (`cpe.depth == 0`).

**Retired outright, with no compatibility shim:** `chain[n].*`,
`edge_devices[n].*`, `core_devices[n].*`, the `position` attribute, and
`PlaybookStep.target_position`. `ng2_topology_drop` refuses to run over any
playbook whose definition still contains them.

Addressing is by **category**, not device-type slug and not relative hop.
Category is the stable semantic role ("OLT") on a curated, platform-global table
with a unique immutable key; a device-type slug is the hardware ("Huawei MA5800")
and would break every playbook on a vendor swap. Relative hops (`parent.parent.*`)
break the instant a splitter is inserted mid-path — the exact positional
fragility this cycle exists to remove — and have no downward form, so a
core-router playbook could never name the CPE. Addressing is *path*-relative
rather than *upstream*-relative for the same reason.

`variables` remains a **flat** dict whose keys are the whole dotted strings:
`path.olt.serial` is a key, not a walk. A nested dict under a namespace prefix
deliberately does **not** satisfy a dotted token — allowing it would be attribute
access by the back door (ADR-006).

> ⚠️ **Both token regexes in this module FAIL OPEN.**
> `_DEVICE_VARIABLE_PATTERN` now recognizes `device|cpe|path.<category>` and
> `_playbook_references_token` matches a single token; each tolerates the doc-34
> `| filter` suffix (`_FILTER_SUFFIX`). A namespace that is emitted but not
> listed in the pattern does not raise, does not warn, and does not fail a test
> that is not looking for it — it quietly turns a hard resolution error into a
> partial run that half-configures a paying customer. Add a namespace here in the
> same commit you add it anywhere else;
> `test_device_variable_pattern_matches_the_new_namespaces` exists solely to
> catch that omission.

### `provisioning_runs.py`

| Function | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `run_idempotency_key(client_service_id, purpose, dry_run)` | `path-{service_id}-{purpose_lower}[-dry]` — deliberately mirrors the shape backend-erp's manual endpoint has always used, so a run and a legacy standalone job never collide in the same namespace |
| `find_in_flight_run(db, company_id, key)` | Dedupe lookup over `IN_FLIGHT = (QUEUED, RUNNING, PENDING_INFORM)`. That tuple **must** mirror the predicate on `uq_provisioning_run_company_idem`; if they disagree, the dedupe check and the unique index disagree and one of them starts raising `IntegrityError` |
| `create_run(db, client_service, purpose, dry_run, triggered_by, ..., resolution=None)` | Resolves (or accepts an already-resolved `ResolvedProvisioning`, which the manual endpoint passes so it can 422 with the error list before touching anything), snapshots `path`/`plan`/`frames`, opens the run, and queues **only its first child**. Resolution happens exactly once per run |
| `advance_run(db, job) -> ProvisioningJob \| None` | Called when a job reaches a terminal state. A standalone job (`run_id` NULL) is a **no-op** — ACS reboots and connectivity probes must keep behaving exactly as they did. Any non-SUCCEEDED status stops the run and the run takes that status (continuing to the OLT after the CPE step failed would leave the network configured for a subscriber whose own device is not). On success it queues the next child; when the plan is exhausted the run goes SUCCEEDED, stamps `finished_at`, and — for a non-dry-run ACTIVATION only — clears `client_service.path_changed_at` |

Child jobs derive their idempotency key as `{run_key}#{position}` (so each child
is still individually unique under `uq_provisioning_job_company_idem`), carry
`device_lock_key = "{company_id}:item:{item_id}"`, and get their `variables` from
`shared | device[item_id]`.

**What this module does not do:** it does not evaluate the provisioning gates
(kill switch, dry-run gate). Those live in backend-erp and are called by its
routers before `create_run`, exactly as they are today — and the workflow-engine
path still does not call them (see [limitations.md](limitations.md)).
