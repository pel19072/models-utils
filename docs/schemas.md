# Pydantic Schemas

## Description

Pydantic v2 request/response schemas for all models — 42 modules in
`database_utils/schemas/`, shared between auth-erp and backend-erp to keep API
contracts consistent (frontend-erp consumes the resulting JSON shapes via the
backend proxies).

## Goal

Validate API inputs and serialize API outputs with a single shared schema
definition across services.

## Schema Modules (in `database_utils/schemas/`)

One module per entity. `schemas/__init__.py` star-imports all modules and runs
`model_rebuild()` to resolve circular Order/RecurringOrder references.

| Domain | Modules |
|---|---|
| Auth / tenancy | `user`, `company`, `role`, `permission`, `invitation`, `notification`, `audit_log`, `requests` (Login + flat company-only Signup), `email_verification`, `password_reset` |
| SaaS billing | `tier`, `subscription`, `payment_method`, `billing_invoice`, `tier_change_request` — rb1 extends `tier` and `subscription` (see below) |
| CRM | `client`, `custom_field`, `order`, `order_item`, `payment`, `invoice`, `product` (legacy), `recurring_order` (legacy), `task`, `task_state`, `task_template`, `integration` |
| ISP | `service_plan`, `client_service`, `inventory`, `playbook`, `device_category`, `insight` (Cycle 4) |
| Network config (Cycle 5) | `acs_registration`, `device_credential`, `network_access`, `provisioning_settings` |
| Workflow | `workflow`, `workflow_template` |
| Generic | `pagination` — `PaginatedResponse[T]` wrapper |

Two modules have been deleted over the life of this repo, and the distinction
matters when reading `__init__.py`:

- `schemas/network.py` — deleted with the free-form network-graph removal
  (Cycle 2 `c2d_graph_removal`); a comment in `__init__.py` still records it.
- `schemas/topology.py` — deleted in **Cycle 10** (doc 35) together with the
  `Topology` / `TopologyDeviceType` / `TopologyPlaybook` models. Its one
  still-needed export, **`normalize_purpose`**, moved to
  [`schemas/playbook.py`](#cycle-10-network-graph-doc-35--schema-changes) —
  purposes now key playbook *bindings*, not topologies.

## Connections to Other Components

- **auth-erp** and **backend-erp** import schemas directly from this package
- **Models** ([auth-models.md](auth-models.md), [crm-models.md](crm-models.md),
  [isp-models.md](isp-models.md), [workflow-models.md](workflow-models.md)):
  schemas mirror model fields
- **frontend-erp**: no direct dependency; its API responses are shaped by
  these schemas via the backends

## Key Implementation Details

- `Out` schemas use `from_attributes=True` for ORM compatibility
- Sensitive fields are excluded from `Out` schemas (e.g. `password_hash`,
  integration `credentials`)
- `PaginatedResponse[T]`: generic paginated wrapper
- `order_item.product_id` is deprecated but still honored (catalog-merge
  rollback window — see [limitations.md](limitations.md))
- UUID fields serialize as strings in JSON responses

### Cycle 7 (core config, doc 25) — extensions to existing modules

- `device_category`: `tier` on Base/Update with a normalizing validator
  (strip/upper, must be in `DEVICE_CATEGORY_TIERS`, empty → None) so the DB
  CHECK never fires as a raw 500
- `inventory`: `DeviceType*.cli_platform` (free string); `InventoryItem*`
  mgmt surface — `mgmt_host`/`mgmt_port`/`cli_protocol` (normalizing validator
  against `CLI_PROTOCOLS`) PATCHable via the existing inventory update; the
  worker-stamped `mgmt_last_check_at`/`mgmt_last_check_ok` appear **only** on
  `InventoryItemOut` (read-only)
- ~~`topology`~~: the pinned-chain write shapes (`TopologyChainEntryIn/Out`,
  `TopologyCreate`/`TopologyUpdate`) went with the module in Cycle 10
- `playbook`: `PLAYBOOK_DRIVERS` gains `ping`; `PlaybookStep.target_item_id`
  (and the same on `PlaybookPrecondition`) — an inventory_item id or a
  `{{variable}}` rendered by the executor, declared so it round-trips through
  `model_dump()` instead of being silently dropped
- `client_service`: `ClientServiceOut.install_state`/`installed_at` — read-only
  (deliberately absent from `ClientServiceUpdate`; written only by backend-erp's
  `recompute_install_state`)

### Brownfield adoption (doc 30) — `client_service` schema changes

- `ClientServiceOut` gains `adopted_at`/`adopted_by_user_id`/`adoption_note`
  (Out-only, never on Create/Update — `migration_source` precedent) and
  `activation_evidence` (Out-only, backend-COMPUTED — not a DB column; values
  from `isp.ACTIVATION_EVIDENCE_VALUES`: `'provisioned'` | `'attested'` |
  `None`; populated only on list/detail/adopt/un-adopt responses — `None`
  elsewhere means "not computed", not "no evidence")
- `ClientServiceAdoptIn` — `POST /client-services/{id}/adopt` body: `note`
  required non-empty (stripping validator), `installed_at` optional historical
  install date (applied only while the service's `installed_at` is NULL). The
  service-lifecycle cycle's `topology_id` field was removed again in Cycle 10 —
  where the CPE sits in the plant is stated by attaching the node, not by the
  attestation. Inherited by `ClientServiceAdoptBulkItem`, so the bulk campaign
  path accepts the same shape
- `ClientServiceAdoptBulkItem` (AdoptIn + `client_service_id`) and
  `ClientServiceAdoptBulkIn` (`items`, 1–500) — `POST /client-services/adopt-bulk`
  body
- `ClientServiceAdoptBulkRowResult` (`status` `'adopted'`|`'error'`; `error`
  `'NOT_FOUND'`|`'ALREADY_ADOPTED'`) and `ClientServiceAdoptBulkOut`
  (`results` + `adopted_count`/`error_count`) — the bulk response (per-row,
  never all-or-nothing)

### Client install-field removal (doc 31) — `client` schema changes

- `ClientBase`/`ClientUpdate` (and thus `ClientCreate`/`ClientOut`) drop
  `installation_status`/`installation_date` — the columns and the
  `InstallationStatus` enum were removed by `cf1_drop_client_install_fields`
  (install truth is `client_service.install_state`)
- `ClientOut` gains `services_total`/`services_installed` (`int`, default
  `0`) — the services-summary rollup, Out-only and backend-COMPUTED by
  backend-erp's clients list/detail endpoints from `client_service` rows
  (`install_state='INSTALLED'` for the second count); never stored, never on
  Create/Update (`activation_evidence` precedent)

### Recurrente tenant billing (rb1) — `tier` / `subscription` schema changes

- `SubscriptionOut` gains `recurrente_subscription_id`/`card_last4`/`card_brand`
  (Optional, mirror the rb1 columns)
- `TierOut` gains `recurrente_product_id`/`recurrente_price_id`/
  `recurrente_price_yearly_id` (Optional — admin-facing)
- `TierPublic` gains `purchasable: bool = False` — stamped by the endpoint from
  `recurrente_price_id` presence; the raw price id is never exposed publicly

### Cycle 8 (network UX, doc 26) — `playbook` schema changes

- `PlaybookBase` drops `target_vendor` and `target_category`; `PlaybookCreate`
  drops them from its optional overrides too. **This half stands.**
- `PlaybookOut` drops `target_category_id`. Cycle 8 also added
  `topology_id: Optional[UUID]` and `PlaybookStep.target_position`; **both were
  removed again in Cycle 10** — see below.
- `PlaybookDefinition` is otherwise unchanged (steps still carry `target_item_id`)

### Cycle 10 (network graph, doc 35) — schema changes

`schemas/topology.py` is **deleted** along with its models.

`schemas/playbook.py`:

- **hosts `normalize_purpose(v)`** now — strip → upper → replace `' '`/`'-'`
  with `'_'` → regex-validate against `PLAYBOOK_PURPOSE_PATTERN` (renamed from
  `TOPOLOGY_PURPOSE_PATTERN`, `models/isp.py`). Deliberately module-level and
  importable: the provision endpoint body schema
  (`ClientServiceProvisionIn`), the binding endpoints and the engine's
  `ENQUEUE_PROVISIONING` config path all share this exact normalization, so a
  tenant typing `'Activation'` or `'activation '` always matches the seeded
  `ACTIVATION` binding.
- `PlaybookBase` carries **no ownership field at all** — a playbook row is again
  a plain company-scoped library entry. `topology_id` is gone from `PlaybookOut`;
  ownership lives in the `device_type_playbook` / `inventory_item_playbook`
  tables ([network-models.md](network-models.md)).
- `PlaybookStep.target_position` is **deleted**. A playbook binds to one device
  type and therefore runs on exactly one device, so there is no chain slot left
  to address: the executor defaults the step target to `{{device.item_id}}` and
  `target_item_id` remains the power-user override.

`schemas/client_service.py`:

- `ClientServiceBase` drops `topology_id` and gains the **two network inputs**:
  - `cpe_item_id: Optional[UUID]` — the subscriber's edge device. Nullable,
    because a brownfield service attested from the field legitimately has no
    equipment record.
  - `cpe_parent_id: Optional[UUID]` — **write-only**. It attaches the CPE under
    that node in the same request so the two inputs land together or not at all,
    but it is a property of the *item*, not of the service, and is never echoed
    back on `ClientServiceOut`.
- `ClientServiceUpdate` swaps `topology_id` for the same two fields.
- `ClientServiceOut` gains `path_changed_at: Optional[datetime]` —
  machine-written, never accepted on an Update schema.
- `ClientServiceAdoptIn` **drops `topology_id`**: attestation records that a
  service was *already installed*, while where its CPE sits in the plant is a
  separate physical fact stated by attaching the node.

> **Known drift — two vestigial topology surfaces remain.**
> `ServicePlanBase`/`ServicePlanUpdate.default_topology_id` is still declared in
> `schemas/service_plan.py`, and `utils/workflow_fields.py` still lists
> `client_service.topology_id` (`fk_to: "topology"`) as a trigger-context field.
> The backing **column and table are gone** (`ng2_topology_drop`), so the first
> is an accepted-but-ignored request field that can never round-trip and the
> second is a trigger field that can never match. Nothing reads them; they are
> inert rather than dangerous, but they are not intended and should be removed in
> a follow-up. Recorded here so the wiki does not claim a cleanliness the code
> does not have.
>
> No Pydantic schema exists for `ProvisioningRun` — backend-erp shapes the
> `/automations/runs` response itself.

### Auth overhaul — request-schema changes (no DB migration)

Company-only signup with locale-aware transactional email:

- `requests.py`: `SignupCompanyRequest` is now **flat and minimal** —
  `company_name` (2..255), `name` (2..255), `email` (EmailStr), `password`
  (min 8), `locale` (`Literal["es","en"]`, default `"es"`). The old nested
  `{company: CompanyCreate, user: UserCreate}` shape and **`SignupUserRequest`
  are deleted** (users are invitation-only; no self-serve user signup).
- `email_verification.py`: `ResendConfirmationRequest` gains `locale`
  (es/en, default es).
- `password_reset.py`: `PasswordResetRequestSchema` gains `locale`;
  `PasswordResetConfirmSchema.new_password` min length raised 6 → 8 (all
  password minimums aligned at 8).
- `invitation.py`: `InvitationCreate` gains `locale` (used for the invitation
  email language); `InvitationAccept` is now `{token, name, password}` with
  `password` min length 8 — the `age` field was **removed** (the accept
  handler passes `age=0` explicitly; no model change).

The `locale` values feed the localized email templates/subjects — see
[email-service.md](email-service.md).

## Environment Variables

None — schemas are pure Python/Pydantic.
