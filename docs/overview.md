# Overview

## What models-utils is

models-utils (pip package **`database-utils`**, Python module **`database_utils`**,
v1.12.0) is the **shared data layer** of the Uplink ISP platform. It is a
pip-installable Python library — **not a running service**. There is no server,
no port, and no entry point; it executes only inside its consumers and as an
Alembic migration runner.

The three-way naming mismatch (repo `models-utils` / package `database-utils` /
module `database_utils`) is historical.

## Role in the platform

Uplink is a multi-tenant vertical SaaS for cable & internet providers. Its two
backends (`backend-erp` at `/api/crm/v1`, `auth-erp` at `/api/auth/v1` and
`/api/admin/v1`) share **one PostgreSQL database** and never call each other over
HTTP — their coupling is this library: shared models, shared schemas, and a
shared JWT `SECRET_KEY` validated through `jwt_utils`.

models-utils is the **schema authority**: every DB change is a model edit here
plus an Alembic autogenerate revision, followed by a SHA pin bump in the
consuming backends. Its CI blocks PRs that change models without a revision.

## What it owns

1. **SQLAlchemy ORM models** for all four domains — auth/tenancy/SaaS-billing
   ([auth-models.md](auth-models.md)), CRM ([crm-models.md](crm-models.md)),
   ISP vertical ([isp-models.md](isp-models.md)), and workflow automation
   ([workflow-models.md](workflow-models.md)). The ISP module also holds the
   Cycle 4 **insights** models (`InsightDashboard`, `InsightChart`) and the
   Cycle 5 **network-config** models (GenieACS/TR-069 — see
   [network-models.md](network-models.md)). All models use UUID v4 primary
   keys and `created_at`/`updated_at` timestamps.
2. **Pydantic v2 schemas** — 42 modules shared between services
   ([schemas.md](schemas.md)).
3. **Alembic migrations + idempotent seeds** — 40 revisions; RBAC, tier, and
   ISP catalog/template seeds run automatically after upgrade
   ([migrations.md](migrations.md)).
4. **Cross-service utilities** — JWT, password hashing, permission checks,
   audit logging, pagination, Guatemala timezone helpers, SSRF guard, OTEL
   helpers, and AES-256-GCM envelope encryption (`crypto.py`, for device
   credentials) ([utilities.md](utilities.md)) — and, crucially, the **workflow
   engine** and **provisioning resolution** logic
   ([workflow-engine.md](workflow-engine.md)).
5. **Transactional email service** — abstract interface + SMTP implementation
   with 8 Jinja2 HTML templates ([email-service.md](email-service.md)).
6. **FastAPI plumbing** — `get_db` session dependency, audit context
   dependencies, request-logging ASGI middleware.

## Consumers

| Service | Relationship |
|---|---|
| `backend-erp` (CRM API + provisioning worker) | pip pin by commit SHA |
| `auth-erp` | pip pin by commit SHA |
| `cron-erp` | pip dependency (RecurringOrder models) |
| `frontend-erp` | none directly — consumes JSON shaped by these schemas via backend proxies |
| repo-root `docker-compose.yml` | builds this repo's Dockerfile as the one-shot `migrate` service |

Details in [connections.md](connections.md).

## Tests

`tests/` holds 13 files, ~66 tests (`pytest.ini` sets `asyncio_mode = auto`),
running against in-memory SQLite so CI needs only placeholder `POSTGRES_*` env.
Coverage: workflow engine, topology purpose resolution, provisioning resolution,
SSRF, JWT expiry, token utils, email schemas/service/templates/SMTP, permission
UUIDs, smoke.
