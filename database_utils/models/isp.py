"""
ISP vertical models: service plans, subscriber services, network inventory,
topology, and provisioning automation.

Design rationale: docs/isp-platform/00-architecture-decisions.md (repo root),
docs/isp-platform/18-cycle2-design.md (D1-D10, entity merge + topology rework).
- Hybrid inventory (ADR-002): hot fields as columns, vendor long-tail in
  schema-validated JSONB (`attributes` validated against the catalog's
  `attribute_schema`).
- Topology as an ordered device-type chain (D5, Cycle 2): the free-form
  network graph (network_node/network_node_type/network_link, ADR-003) was
  removed in revision c2d_graph_removal — device kinds are resolved by TYPE
  from a client's assigned inventory, not by a mapped node graph.
- Durable provisioning queue (ADR-005): provisioning_job rows are claimed by
  the worker via SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.

    Single source of truth for both the backend pre-flight gate and the
    frontend's per-purpose action buttons (founder decision 3: a button is
    enabled only when the machine allows it AND a playbook exists for that
    purpose — this answers the first half).

    Four cases:
      1. ACTIVATION — special-cased, because it writes no status and therefore
         has no target to look up in ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS. Legal ONLY from
         PENDING_INSTALL: an already-ACTIVE service gets no Activate button,
         and re-activating a SUSPENDED service is REACTIVATION's job.
      2. REACTIVATION — ALSO special-cased, and for a reason that is not
         obvious: it is the exact inverse of SUSPENSION, so it is legal ONLY
         from SUSPENDED. The generic rule (case 3) would wrongly allow it from
         PENDING_INSTALL, because its target ACTIVE happens to be a legal
         transition out of PENDING_INSTALL — that edge belongs to ACTIVATION
         and is owned by recompute_install_state, NOT by a status write. Taking
         the generic path there would mark a never-installed service ACTIVE and
         start billing it (status/activation_date/billing_status/
         next_generation_date all written) for an install that never happened
         and a CPE that was never linked. The legacy
         `POST /client-services/{id}/reactivate` endpoint has always rejected
         this ("Only SUSPENDED services can be reactivated"); both paths share
         `_apply_reactivation`, so they must agree.
      3. Any other canonical purpose — legal iff its target status is a legal
         transition out of `current_status`.
      4. A tenant-defined custom purpose (purposes are extensible free strings,
         see PLAYBOOK_PURPOSE_PATTERN) — falls through to True: it is
         enqueue-only, writes no status, so there is no transition to police.
         It MUST NOT raise; an unknown purpose is a normal tenant config, not a
         bug.

    Accepts `current_status` as a ClientServiceStatus or its string value, and
    `purpose` in any case/spacing the normalizer would accept.
