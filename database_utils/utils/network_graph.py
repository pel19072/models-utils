"""Traversal of the per-company network graph (doc 35 §3).

The plant is a strict tree of `inventory_item` rows joined by `parent_id`. This
module is the only place that walks it.

Two invariants are load-bearing and appear in every query here:

1. `company_id` is filtered in BOTH the anchor and the recursive term. A tree
   that spans tenants cannot be produced through the API — the DB trigger
   `trg_inventory_item_graph_guard` rejects a cross-company parent — but a
   traversal that only filtered the anchor would still happily follow such an
   edge if one ever appeared through a direct DB write. Filtering both terms
   makes cross-tenant traversal impossible rather than merely unlikely.

2. Every recursion is bounded by MAX_PATH_DEPTH. The trigger already rejects
   cycles, so the bound is a backstop rather than the primary guard — but an
   unbounded recursive CTE over a cycle does not error, it hangs, and that is
   the worst possible failure mode for a query on the provisioning hot path.

Written against SQLAlchemy Core's recursive-CTE API rather than raw `text()` so
the same code runs on Postgres and on the in-memory SQLite database the unit
tests build with `create_all`.
