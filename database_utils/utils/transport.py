"""Transport resolution (spec 2026-08-13 §9, canon N1/N4, doc 34 canon R23).

The ONE place that turns an InventoryItem plus its tenant's transport
configuration into the address a driver actually dials. It lives in
models-utils so the CLI drivers, the ping driver and any future frame builder
share a single implementation rather than three drifting copies.

Two invariants this module exists to hold:

  * The item is never mutated. mgmt_host/mgmt_port describe the DEVICE; this
    function describes the PATH to it (spec N1, doc 34 §1.3). If a database
    reader ever sees a gateway address in mgmt_host, something has gone wrong.

  * It fails closed. Doc 34 canon R23 rewritten: for any tenant not in
    'direct' mode, an unresolvable target is an error code, never a fall
    through to dialling the private address from wherever the worker happens
    to be running. The original R23 predicate keyed on "does this company hold
    a non-direct row", which a NAT tenant implemented as 'direct' would have
    satisfied vacuously — that is why NAT gets its own mode values.

network_access.mgmt_subnets is deliberately not read. Its documented
longest-prefix resolver was never implemented and NAT does not need it.
