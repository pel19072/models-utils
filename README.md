# models-utils (`database-utils`)

Shared data layer of the **Uplink** ISP platform — a pip-installable Python library
(package name `database-utils`, module `database_utils`, currently v1.13.0). It is
**not a running service**: it has no server, no port, and no entry point of its own.

models-utils owns everything that must be identical across the platform's backends:

- All **SQLAlchemy ORM models** for the single shared PostgreSQL database (auth, CRM, ISP, and workflow domains)
- All **Pydantic v2 request/response schemas** shared between services
- **Alembic migrations** plus idempotent seed scripts (RBAC, tiers, ISP catalog/templates)
- Cross-service **utilities**: JWT, password hashing, permission checks, audit logging, pagination, Guatemala timezone helpers, SSRF guard, OTEL helpers — and, crucially, the **workflow engine** and **provisioning resolution** logic
- The transactional **email service** (abstract + SMTP implementation) with Jinja2 HTML templates

It is the **schema authority** for Uplink: every database change flows through this
repo (model edit → Alembic autogenerate revision → SHA pin bump in the consuming
backends). Consumers — `backend-erp` (CRM API + provisioning worker), `auth-erp`,
and `cron-erp` — install it pinned by commit SHA:

```
database-utils @ git+https://github.com/pel19072/models-utils.git@<commit-sha>
```

For the platform big picture (service map, request flow, release model), see the
root repo docs and [docs/connections.md](docs/connections.md).

## Tech Stack

- Python >= 3.11 (CI runs 3.12) — MIT license
- SQLAlchemy >= 2.0, Alembic >= 1.12, psycopg2-binary
- Pydantic >= 2.12.5, FastAPI >= 0.100 (dependency helpers)
- PyJWT, bcrypt/passlib, loguru, Jinja2, aiosmtplib, opentelemetry-api (API only)

## Quickstart

### As part of the full local stack (recommended)

From the **repo root** (`/home/rpellecer/cable`, one level above this repo):

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The `migrate` compose service builds this repo's `Dockerfile` and runs
`alembic upgrade head` (+ seeds) against the local Postgres (`erp`/`erp`/`erp` @
`localhost:5432`) before the backends start.

### Standalone library development

```bash
pip install -e .                                  # editable install
pytest -v                                         # tests (in-memory SQLite; needs placeholder POSTGRES_* env)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"  # generate a migration (needs a reachable DB)
```

## Critical Rules

- **Never push directly to `main`** — feature branches + composed release PRs only (see [docs/deployment-production.md](docs/deployment-production.md)).
- Every model change **must** ship with an Alembic revision — CI blocks PRs that change `database_utils/models/**` without one.
- Additive schema changes are safe once consuming code is ready; **destructive changes** (drop/rename) require all consuming service code in production first.
