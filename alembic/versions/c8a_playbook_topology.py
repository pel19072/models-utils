"""cycle 8 (topology-owned playbooks): drop playbook.target_vendor + target_category_id, add playbook.topology_id

Revision ID: c8a_playbook_topology
Revises: nc2a_core_config
Create Date: 2026-07-17

Doc 26 (docs/isp-platform/26-cycle8-network-ux-design.md) §2. Playbooks become
topology-owned: the topology supplies the device context, so the old
vendor/category targeting columns no longer make sense.

  - DROP playbook.target_vendor and playbook.target_category_id (+ its FK
    fk_playbook_target_category_id, from revision c3b_device_categories).
    Destructive — consuming backend/frontend code ships in the same release
    (Cycles 1-8 have not reached prod), so this is safe.
  - ADD playbook.topology_id UUID FK -> topology.id ON DELETE CASCADE,
    nullable, indexed (ix_playbook_topology_id). NULL = a system/global
    playbook (the seeded per-company core_connectivity_check_*); non-NULL = an
    inline playbook owned by that topology (dies with it on delete).

Hand-written (NOT autogenerate), nc2a_core_config style: guarded/idempotent
ops (DROP ... IF EXISTS, ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS, DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS +
ADD) so a re-run is a no-op, with in-migration assertions verifying each
object's final state. No backfill: existing non-system playbooks are the
Cycle-7 demo ones on develop; topology_id stays NULL until the topology editor
re-saves them (they keep working via TopologyPlaybook meanwhile).

Downgrade totality: re-adds target_vendor / target_category_id (nullable, no
backfill — a partial undo of a destructive drop cannot recover dropped data)
with the RESTRICT FK to device_category restored, and drops topology_id with
its FK + index.
