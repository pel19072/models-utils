"""namespaced playbook variables + provisioning-params rows (doc 33)

Founder decision 2026-07-20: playbook template variables get a namespace and
the flat names are RETIRED, not aliased. `device1_serial` becomes
`edge_devices[0].serial`, the plan's parameters move under `service_plan.*`,
and author-declared variables move under `input.*`. Nothing bare survives, so
a mistyped namespace can no longer resolve silently to an unrelated value.

This rewrite is deliberately destructive — playbooks are not yet in production
(founder confirmed), so there is no back-compat alias layer to maintain. Two
data migrations:

1. `playbook.definition` — every {{token}} is rewritten through the name map
   below. Definitions are executable device configuration, so a rewritten
   playbook has its `last_dry_run_version` cleared: machine-edited config must
   be re-simulated before it is allowed near hardware again (canon C7 gate).
   `version` is deliberately NOT bumped — bumping it and clearing the stamp
   both re-gate the playbook, and bumping would make the idempotency check
   below (byte-identical on re-run) impossible to assert.

2. `service_plan.provisioning_params` — the flat {"vlan": 110} dict becomes
   [{"key": "vlan", "value": 110, "description": null}] so the UI can carry a
   human explanation per parameter. Insertion order is preserved.

Workflow action_config `variables` are also rewritten: their keys are author
input and now travel namespaced (`input.*`).

Idempotent: re-running finds no legacy tokens and leaves every row
byte-identical.
